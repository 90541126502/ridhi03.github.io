<h2>ABOUT</h2>
<p>My name is Ridhi Khosla. I am 20 years old. I am a curious individual, passionate about learning and helping others. With interest in technology and a love for creative writing, I strive to bridge the gap between knowledge and communication. Enthusiastic about innovation and always seeking new adventures, I embrace challenges as opportunities for growth.</p>
<p>I love being in nature and going on adventures. It makes me feel peaceful, and I enjoy trying new things. I also like growing as a person, and that includes making good friends and being kind and open with them. In my life, I want to do things that help others and make the world better, all while appreciating each moment.</p>
